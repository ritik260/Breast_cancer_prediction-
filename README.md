## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the early **prediction of breast cancer** using various supervised machine learning models. The goal is to help in the early diagnosis of breast cancer to improve survival rates and reduce treatment costs.

## 💡 Models Applied

| Algorithm | Full Form             | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------|
| DT        | Decision Tree         | ~93%         |
| LG        | Logistic Regression   | ~95%         |
| NB        | Naive Bayes           | ~92%         |
| RF        | Random Forest         | ~96%         |
| **SVM**   | **Support Vector Machine** | **⭐ 97%** |

✅ **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** performed the best with **97% accuracy** on the testing dataset.
